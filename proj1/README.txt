Your NAME: Gregory Smith

Any help you got from other people:
	I did not get any help from other people.

Any websites you used (besides the course website and cppreference.com):
	I used guru99 to read more about streams and FILE*.

What did you think of this project?
(Too easy, too hard, confusing, awesome, mind-blowing, boring, ...?)
	It was really satisfying to finally get it to work. I actually
	enjoyed it and I feel like debugging my programs was a great
	learning experience. This stuff is pretty simple compared to the
	really complicated stuff we see computers do every day, but I always
	really like to pull back the curtain to de-mystify things in any
	way I can understand.
