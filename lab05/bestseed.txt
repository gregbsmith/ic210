In order to make brute.c, I modified realcraps.c to return the value
of the seed that gave the highest number of consecutive wins to start
out. I used a for loop from INT_MIN to INT_MAX to check every int value.
The program will print the highest number of player wins that started
and the seed that gave that case.

Unfortunately, the program has not stopped running yet. It's currently
1506 on Thursday 1 OCT.

It is currently 2116. The program from INT_MIN to INT_MAX still has
not stopped. I am worried that I made an infinite for loop by adding 1
to INT_MAX only to get INT_MIN like Dr. Roche, warned me about, but
I am also afraid to end the program because I am holding out some
irrational hope that I actually did the program right and it might end
and give me a useful result any minute now.

I changed it to go from -100000 to 100000 to give a little more sane
of a scope to test. I'll see if that one ends.

The brute.c program from -100000 to 100000 just ended! It gave me a
seed of -49505, which gave 17 wins. I'll see if I can do better.
If the submit system were to run my program for brute, it is possible
that my student result could contain a more optimal seed. However, I
don't know if that is the case, and I don't know how likely it is that
this thing is ever going to end.
